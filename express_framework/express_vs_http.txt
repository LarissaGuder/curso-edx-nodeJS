Express vs. http
If you write serious apps using only core Node.js modules (refer to the previous snippet for an example), you most likely find yourself reinventing the wheel by writing the same code continually for similar tasks, such as the following:

Parsing of HTTP request bodies
Parsing of cookies
Managing sessions
Organizing routes with a chain of if conditions based on URL paths and HTTP methods of the requests
Determining proper response headers based on data types
URL params and query strings parsing
Automatic response headers
Routes and better code organization
Myriads of plugins (called middleware)
Request body parsing (with a module)
Authentication, validation, session and more! (with modules)
With Express you can develop APIs much faster!
